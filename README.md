<h1>Hi there ðŸ‘‹</h1>
<font face="Cascadia Code">
I'm Manik! This is my github! Seems you've stumbled here, either by accident or on purpose.
Either way, if you enjoy waht you see, give it a download and maybe me a follow?

- ðŸ”­ I am currently working on <a href="https://github.com/ManikSharma69420/PyGameChessPuzzles">PyGameChessPuzzles</a> rn and <a href="https://maniksharma69420.github.io/">my website</a> and Godot and Arduino stuff (lol)

- ðŸŒ± I am currently learning <a href="https://godotengine.org/">Godot</a>, C/C++ and <a href="https://pygame.org">pygame</a> and random stuff tbh

- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything! Related to my repos or not! I'm happy to have a simple chat! Family friendly, though!

- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Contact me on <a href="mailto:hello@maniksharma.xyz">this email</a> and ask me anything!

- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him

- âš¡ Fun fact: I use VSCode, Visual Studio, Arduino IDE, Node.js, Godot, Sublime Text and believe it or not, Notepad! (rarely though lol) I also ADORE the font Cascadia Code by Microsoft and System UI by Apple (you probably guessed that if you visited my website or used my SimplTextEditor lol)
