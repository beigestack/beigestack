Hi there 👋

I'm Manik! This is my github! Seems you've stumbled here, either by accident or on purpose.
Either way, if you enjoy waht you see, give it a download and maybe me a follow?

- 🔭 I am currently working on Python stuff with Pygame rn and my website and Godot and Arduino stuff (lol)

- 🌱 I am currently learning Godot and C/C++

- 💬 Ask me about anything! Related to my repos or not! I'm happy to have a simple chat! Family friendly, though!

- 📫 How to reach me: Contact me on this email : manik.manu@hotmail.com (yes i know its cringe) and ask me anything!

- 😄 Pronouns: he/him

- ⚡ Fun fact: I use VSCodium, Sublime Text and believe it or not, Notepad! (rarely though lol)
